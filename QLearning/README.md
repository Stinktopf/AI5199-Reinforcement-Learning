# QLearning

This code demonstrates a simple value iteration process on a 4x4 grid. Each cell in the grid `G` has a cost associated with moving into it. The script iteratively updates a value table `V` and a corresponding policy `P`, then prints the results after each iteration.

## Execution

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python QLearning.py
   ```
